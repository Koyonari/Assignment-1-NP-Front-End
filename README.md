## This is my Assignment 1 code where I design and develop a responsive website for a fictional band called "Kessoku Band" from an anime called "Bocchi the Rock!"
"Bocchi the Rock!" is an anime with the main cast being a band - a group of 4 friends - Hitori Gotoh, Nijika Ijichi, Ikuyo Kita and Ryo Yamada that produces J-rock songs.  

Fans of the anime "Bocchi the Rock!" can use this website to delve deeper into the anime and their music as well as indulge in official merchandise of the show!   

This single-scroll page website displays the official discography, the next touring dates, allows fans to purchase merch, learn more about their favourite guitarists, bassist and drummer, and a support section that opens up the possibility to book them for shows.

### Technicalities:
Overview: This is a Single-Scroll Page website that uses parallax scrolling at the top of the website.  Media queries, grid and flexbox were used to make the website responsive. A navigation bar is used and it is fixed at the top that occupies 100% of the width of the site that has texts in it. Clicking on the texts brings you to the corresponding part of the website smoothly. The cart page opens up the cart sidebar which viewers can see what they have in there.

The Tours section shows real life tours that people can go to to watch live performances of the discography from "Bocchi the Rock!". There are left and right arrows that you can click to view the next or previous tour poster, this was made using javascript.

The Discography section shows 12 songs from their discography. These are made using the grid method and auto fit grid template columns. The animation when loaded in is made using deferred javascript and css.

The Merch section shows 12 merchandise that viewers can purchase. These were made using flexbox. Clicking on the cart button brings the viewere back to the top of the merch section.

The About section gives viewers info on the history of the anime, band and songs. These were made using flexbox.

The Support section gives people who want to book them for shows to get into contact with them via email.

The Cart section shows what items are in the cart, what quantity and price of the items and the subtotal. It is using media queries to occupy the whole page when on a smaller device.

The Scroll To Top button on the bottom left of the screen is made using javascript to bring the user back to the start of the single scroll page to avoid having to manually scroll all the way to the top.
