## This is my Assignment 1 code where I design and develop a responsive website for a famous 60s trio band called the "BeeGees".
This website shows the discography and background information of the BeeGees which was formed by three brothers and are famous for their pop songs. The BeeGees have a very distinct and signature sound with the help of their vibrato lead vocals and the falsetto. This website also have a merch section where fans can buy albums of their discography and merchandise.
